    <li>Mouse</li>
    <li>Headset</li>
    <li>A LAN cable longer than 5 meters (if you don't have one that's okay, we have enough)</li>
    <li>Power extension cord (only if you need more than one socket for your pc)</li>
</ul>

<h3>What not to bring</h3>
You are forbidden from bringing speakers, since they are distracting to other players.
You are also forbidden from using your own network switches, routers or hubs, since these devices can cause network connectivity issues when not properly configured.
Furthermore we discourage you to bring your own drinks and food, as they are sold for a cheap price at the bar.
The maximum size of a monitor is 24 inch. If you have a laptop, please don't bring a monitor.

<h3>Connectivity</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Turn off your Wi-Fi (you can use Wi-Fi only if you do not have an ethernet port)</li>
    <li>If you've set a static IP previously, change your settings back to DHCP, our network does not support static IP addresses</li>
    <li>Disable the IPHelper service if PvP.net keeps disconnecting</li>
</ul>

<h3>In game rules</h3>
There are several in-game rules you implicitly accept when participating in the tournament:
<ul>
    <li>
        Teams that are eliminated during the tournament
        may play matches against other eliminated teams as
        they wish. However, these games will not count towards the leaderboard and are not under supervision
        of the organization.
    </li>
    <li>
        Only students of the Radboud University  Nijmegen may participate.
    </li>
    <li>
        A participant can only be in one team. We encourage
        teams to make sure the skill level of their members
        is somewhat equal.
    </li>
    <li>
        Applications can be entered online through the website. All applications will be accepted as long as the team's members are all eligible for application. There is a maximum of 32
        teams that can enter the tournament. Teams applying when the tournament is full will be placed on the waiting list.
    </li>
    <li>
        Teams that are placed on the waiting list will receive an email with an invitation if a place has come
        available. This is done on a first come first serve basis.
    </li>
    <li>
        Participants are not allowed to apply for the tournament using a smurf account.
    </li>
    <li>
        All matches will be played on Summoner's Rift in
        Tournament Draft mode.
    </li>
    <li>
        Pausing is only allowed when absolutely necessary.
        Pausing the game while not necessary counts as unfair play.
    </li>
    <li>
        When the game has ended, both team's captains need
        to leave the scoreboard open until the match results appear on the <a href="@Url.Action("Schedule", "Timetable")">Schedule</a> page.
        If the match has not appeared after 5 minutes, find a member of the organization. He or she can enter the scores manually.
    </li>
    <li>
        The following actions are considered unfair play. If any participant performs any of the following actions, he will receive a penalty as decided by the organizers.
        <ul>
            <li>
                The use of any cheat program;
            </li>
            <li>
                An intentional disconnection without reason;
            </li>
            <li>
                The use of any settings exceeding the standard
                and permitted settings;
            </li>
            <li>
                Intentionally allowing an opponent to win or
                colluding with another team to decide a match
                outcome or split prize money;
            </li>
            <li>
                Unsportsmanlike conduct or disruptive behaviour such as inappropriate and/or unprofessional actions directed towards another player or a member of the organization;
            </li>
            <li>
                The use of a game bug;
            </li>
            <li>
                Pausing the game while not strictly necessary.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        A first offense can be penalized by a warning or a game forfeiture (meaning you lose the match). The organization may choose the penalty depending on the severity of the offense.
        A second offense will result in tournament disqualification. Note that offenses by different members of the same team add up and are not counted as two separate first offenses.  
    </li>
    <li>
        CognAC and the members of the organisation are not responsible for any damage to property or health. By participating in the tournament you accept these rules implicitly.
    </li>
