                        Teams that are eliminated during the tournament
                        may play matches against other eliminated teams as

                        A first offense can be penalized by a warning or a game forfeiture (meaning you lose the match). The organization may choose the penalty depending on the severity of the offense.
                        A second offense will result in tournament disqualification. Note that offenses by different members of the same team add up and are not counted as two separate first offenses.
